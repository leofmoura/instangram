# Welcome to the fire-angular-gram wiki!

**Here you find a photobook (like instagram) using AngularJS and firebase.**

### What's [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/)?

By definition angular is "Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework". And it's true. Make some web aplication is very easy and you, probably, going to have fun!

### And [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)?

It's a NoSQL database, maintained by google. It's awesome to create fast simple applications because you need to install nothing, just create a application at www.firebase.com and CODE!!!
Firebase isn't free, so: be aware!
